Description: A web application that Developed a web application that enables users to monitor and test soil moisture levels in real-time for optimal plant care. Implemented a notification system using a Discord Bot that alerts users when it's time to water their plants based on customized thresholds and soil moisture readings.

The web app will request one's location and use the coordinates to access a database to withdraw moisture readings. The moisture reading is then displayed onto one's screen. A corresponding legend is provided to give a sense of understanding what the reading means.

Users have the ability to sign up for notifications using Discord. Notifications are sent using a bot. Notifications are based on time intervals, moisture fluctuations, and weather, as well as the option to select other factors that may influence one's plant(s).
